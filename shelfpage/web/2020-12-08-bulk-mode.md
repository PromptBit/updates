# Bulk mode
You can now quickly add lots of books to your ShelfPage library! From the "Add book" page, click the new **Bulk entry** button. Then, just choose a location, and start adding books!

For best results, we recommend using an external USB barcode scanner, which you can typically find online for around $10 to $20.
