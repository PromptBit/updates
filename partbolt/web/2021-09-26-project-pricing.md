# Project pricing
You can now get pricing information for a project! Just open the project and select the new <strong><i class="fas fa-fw fa-chart-line"></i> Pricing</strong> tab. Enter a quantity and we'll search hundreds of distributors to find the best price for each part in your project.

This feature requires a <a href="https://partbolt.com/pricing">paid plan</a>; if you're on a free plan, you can <a href="https://demo.partbolt.com/projects">try our demo</a> to see how it works.

We're already working on some improvements to this feature, such as support for multiple currencies. Have a suggestion? Click the <i class="fas fa-fw fa-comments"></i> button in the top right or email us at <a href="mailto:hello@partbolt.com">hello@partbolt.com</a>.
