# Multi-user support
You can now easily add additional users to your database! Just click the **<i class="fas fa-fw fa-database"></i>** button in the top right and select **<i class="fas fa-fw fa-cog"></i> Manage databases**. Then, from your database's page, you can invite members with their email address.

Note that this currently requires a paid plan. See [our pricing page](https://partbolt.com/pricing) for details.

If you're at the limit of a paid plan and still want to add more users, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@partbolt.com">hello@partbolt.com</a> and we'll be happy to help!
