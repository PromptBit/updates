# Global stock history
We've added the ability to view all stock history across your entire database. This can be done by hovering over the <i class="fas fa-fw fa-chevron-down"></i> in the navigation bar and clicking <strong><i class="fas fa-fw fa-history"></i> History</strong>.

This feature requires a <a href="https://partbolt.com/pricing">paid plan</a> at the Startup level or above; if you're on a free plan, you can <a href="https://demo.partbolt.com/history">try our demo</a> to see how it works.

We've also resolved issues with adding parts by searching for their part number.
