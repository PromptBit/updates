# Link projects to parts
You can now link a project to a part in your inventory! That way, when you complete a build of the project, stock will be added to the corresponding part. The stock is connected back to the project build, meaning it's easy to find out what parts were used in an item.

To get started, open a project, click the new <strong><i class="fas fa-fw fa-boxes"></i> Link to part</strong> button, and follow the instructions. Once you're done, all future builds will prompt you for the location where stock should be added.
