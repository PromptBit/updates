If you're on one of our <a href="https://partbolt.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paid plans</a>, you can now attach files to parts and projects! It's a convenient way to keep datasheets, schematics, and other important documentation right where it's needed.

To try it out, open a part or project and select the new <strong><i class="fas fa-fw fa-paperclip"></i> Attachments</strong> tab.
