# Purchasing
You can now add orders you've placed with other vendors to your PartBolt database. Stock you receive from an order is marked as such, letting you trace parts back to where they originally came from.

To get started, go to the new <strong><i class="fas fa-fw fa-shopping-cart"></i> Purchasing</strong> page.

This feature requires a [paid plan](https://partbolt.com/pricing); if you're on a free plan, you can [try our demo](https://demo.partbolt.com/projects) to see how it works.
