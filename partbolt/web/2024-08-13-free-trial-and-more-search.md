# Free trial and more search options
New accounts now start with a 14 day free trial of the Professional plan, allowing you to try out all of PartBolt's features before subscribing.

(If you're an existing user and want to activate a 14 day trial on your account, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@partbolt.com">hello@partbolt.com</a>!)

Also, we've added extra options to the search page. You can now search through your projects and orders, not just your parts. And, when searching for parts, you can now add filters that limit your search to specific manufacturers or packages.
