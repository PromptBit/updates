# updates
This repository contains update notifications for all [PromptBit](https://promptbit.com) products&mdash;[NoteToScreen](https://notetoscreen.com), [PartBolt](https://partbolt.com), and [ShelfPage](https://shelfpage.com). These notifications inform users when new features have been added, and are made available via the "Updates" menu item in the product's navigation bar.

Updates are grouped into channels, which are defined in the channels.txt file. Channels may include other channels. (for example, the `android` channel includes notifications from the `base` and `mobile` channels)
